# AutoScrollingScrollViewExample

## An example app project to demonstrate how to use `SwiftUIAutoScrollingScrollView`.

## Get Started

Build and run the app.  It'll have 3 buttons at the top: Start, Stop, and Next Message.

- Start will start generating random junk text in the current message.

- Next Message will start a new message

- Stop will stop generating

## Test scrolling

- Hit Start to make it generate.  Let it go a bit and hit Next Message from time to time, if you like.
- As the new content reaches the bottom of the screen, the `AutoScrollingScrollView` will automatically scroll to the bottom
- Now scroll manually.  You should be able to scroll up and down without any interference from the automated scrolling.
- If you scroll all the way back down to the bottom, the automatic scrolling will kick in again.

 
## Important Notes

You'll need to update your Team ID to build and run.
